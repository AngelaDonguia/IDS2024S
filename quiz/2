 Fortran is an ancestor of MATLAB; ABC is an ancestor of Python.
 Logarithm is the exponent a base must be raised to obtain a given number. Example: log2(8) = 3.
S=33(3+6+...+99) = 33(3+99)(33/2) = 33(102)(16.5) = 56,508.
HDDs last longer than magnetic tapes; HDDs typically last 5-10 years, while magnetic tapes can last 15-30 years.
