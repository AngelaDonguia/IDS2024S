ENIAC stands for Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer.
Integers are represented because they are easier to manipulate electronically.
Cache memory is the fastest part of computer memory.
Mechanical Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) are typically the slowest storage devices integrated with computers.
The bit is the smallest unit of information in computer science.
(A) Assembly language. (B) Yes, it needs interpretation.
Fortran is one of the oldest high-level programming languages still in daily use.
It's around 65 years old.
(A) Assembly language. (B) Second-generation.
C was created in the 1970s, C++ in the 1980s, MATLAB/Python in the 1980s.
Assembly language is an ancestor programming language of C.
C is an ancestor programming language of C++.
Fortran is an ancestor programming language of MATLAB, and ABC is an ancestor programming language of Python.
Registers are the fastest part of the memory hierarchy in modern computers.
The bit is typically the smallest memory unit in the memory hierarchy of modern computers.
Access to register memory is significantly faster than RAM in modern computers.
Access to RAM is much faster than typical SSD hard drives in modern computers.
Access to RAM is much faster than typical HDD hard drives in modern computers.
Transistors primarily serve as switches and amplifiers in computers.
Adding more transistors increases power consumption and heat, leading to diminishing returns and challenges in cooling.
Fetch, Decode, Execute.
Yes, depending on various factors like architecture, efficiency, and workload distribution.
Memory access is often the bottleneck in modern computers due to the gap between CPU speed and memory speed.
Dennard Scaling refers to the shrinking of transistor size, MOSFET scaling involves scaling down MOSFETs, and Moore's Law relates to the doubling of transistors on a chip.
The last square would require 2^63 grains, and to fill all squares, it's (2^64) - 1 grains.
Approximately 92.4 billion pounds of rice.
The last square would need 2^63 grains, and the sum is (2^64) - 1 grains.
Approximately 184.5 billion pounds of rice.
It would take several thousand years to produce the required amount of rice grains for this task.
Syntax, Semantics, Control.
Exponential behavior would show a rapid increase, while power-law behavior would show a more gradual, but still increasing, trend in a 2-dimensional plot.
