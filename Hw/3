Deductive reasoning, Inductive reasoning
This reasoning follows deductive logic, where the observation of specific events (crawling out of a jewelry store with stolen goods) leads to a logical implication (the person is a burglar).

Venn diagram
1: Non-negativity: Probabilities must be non-negative. 2:Additivity: The probability of the union of mutually exclusive events is the sum of their individual probabilities. 3: Normalization: The probability of the sample space is 1.
