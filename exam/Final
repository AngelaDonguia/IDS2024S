Model validation involves assessing how well a model performs on unseen data to ensure it generalizes well, while calibration involves adjusting the model's predictions to match the true probabilities or outcomes
Aesthetics in data visualization refer to the visual properties that encode data values, such as color, size, shape, etc


The three pillars of science are observation, experimentation, and theory.
No, logical implication is not the same as physical causation. Logical implication refers to a relationship between statements where one statement logically follows from another, while physical causation involves a direct cause-and-effect relationship between events or phenomena in the real world
For example, in logic, the statement "If it is raining, then the ground is wet" illustrates logical implication, where the presence of rain logically implies that the ground is wet. However, in the physical world, while rain may indeed cause the ground to become wet, the relationship is not merely logical but also involves physical processes such as water falling from the sky and making contact with the ground.
Bayesian probability theory allows for the incorporation of expert (prior) knowledge in scientific inference.
When data is scarce, Bayesian probability theory is the most useful for scientific inference.
Frequentist probability theory cannot define or discuss the probability of the existence of God because it relies solely on empirical evidence and observable frequencies to assign probabilities, which cannot be applied to metaphysical or unobservable concepts like the existence of God

everything is represented by integers in computers because digital circuits work with binary signals, in order to simplifying operations and reducing errors
An ancestor programming language of C is B, developed
The first high-level programming language in computer history is FORTRAN (short for Formula Translation.




No,we cannot represent all real numbers in computers due to limitations in precision and storage capacity.
S= 233(3+99)= 233(102)=1683
